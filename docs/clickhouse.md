# TSBS Supplemental Guide: ClickHouse

ClickHouse is an open source column-oriented database management system capable of real time generation of analytical data reports using SQL queries. 
This supplemental guide explains how the data generated for TSBS is stored, additional flags available when using the data importer (`tsbs_load_clickhouse`), 
and additional flags available for the query runner (`tsbs_run_queries_clickhouse`). 
**This should be read *after* the main README.**

## Data format

Data generated by `tsbs_generate_data` for ClickHouse is serialized in a "pseudo-CSV" format, 
along with a custom header at the beginning. The header is several lines long:
* one line composed of a comma-separated list of tag labels, with the literal string `tags` as the first value in the list
* one or more lines composed of a comma-separated list of field labels, with the hypertable name as the first value in the list
* a blank line

An example for the `cpu-only` use case:
```text
tags,hostname,region,datacenter,rack,os,arch,team,service,service_version,service_environment
cpu,usage_user,usage_system,usage_idle,usage_nice,usage_iowait,usage_irq,usage_softirq,usage_steal,usage_guest,usage_guest_nice
```

Following this, each reading is composed of two rows:
1. a comma-separated list of tag values for the reading, with the literal string `tags` as the first value in the list
1. a comma-separated list of field values for the reading, with the hypertable the reading belongs to being the first value and the timestamp as the second value

An example for the `cpu-only` use case:
```text
tags,host_0,eu-central-1,eu-central-1b,21,Ubuntu15.10,x86,SF,6,0,test
cpu,1451606400000000000,58.1317132304976170,2.6224297271376256,24.9969495069947882,61.5854484633778867,22.9481393231639395,63.6499207106198313,6.4098777048301052,44.8799140503027445,80.5028770761136201,38.2431182911542820
```

## `tsbs_load_clickhouse` Additional Flags


#### `-host` (type: `string`, default: `localhost`)

Hostname of the ClickHouse server.

#### `-user` (type: `string`, default: `default`)

User to use to connect to the ClickHouse server. Yes, default user is really called **default**

#### `-password` (type: `string`, default: ``)

Password to use to connect to the ClickHouse server. Default password is empty


### Miscellaneous

#### `-hash-workers` (type: `boolean`, default: `false`)
Whether to consistently hash data across the multiple insert workers by the
value of the primary (first) tag. For datasets with larger numbers of
devices, this option helps improve data locality on disk which can lead
to better query performance. For datasets with smaller numbers of devices, it is typically not necessary.

#### `-write-profile` (type: `string`, default: none)
File to output periodic CPU and memory statistics. Useful for understanding
system performance while writing data to the database.

## `tsbs_run_queries_clickhouse` Additional Flags

#### `-hosts` (type: `string`, default: `localhost`)

Comma separated list of hostnames for the ClickHouse servers.
Workers are connected to a server in a round-robin fashion.

#### `-user` (type: `string`, default: `default`)

User to use to connect to the ClickHouse server. Yes, default user is really called **default**

#### `-password` (type: `string`, default: ``)

Password to use to connect to the ClickHouse server. Default password is empty

## How to run test. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS example

### Install ClickHouse

Add ClickHouse repo
```bash
sudo bash -c "echo 'deb http://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/deb/stable/ main/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list"
```
Add key and update repolist
```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv E0C56BD4    # optional
sudo apt-get update
```

Install binaries 
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y clickhouse-client clickhouse-server
```
More details on how to get started with ClickHouse is available [https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/getting_started/](here)


Ensure ClickHouse is running
```bash
sudo service clickhouse-server restart
```

### Setup TSBS

Install golang
```bash
sudo apt install golang-1.9
```

Add go binaries to PATH for convenience and setup GOPATH env
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gocode/bin:/usr/lib/go-1.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/gocode"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Apply PATH and GOPATH
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Create initial Go folders
```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/{bin,src}
```

Get and build TSBS
```bash
go get github.com/timescale/tsbs
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/timescale/tsbs/cmd
go get ./...
go install ./...
```

Run test

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/timescale/tsbs/scripts
```

Generate test dataset. This may take some time.
```bash
FORMATS=clickhouse ./generate_data.sh
```

Generate test queries set. This should not take much time
```bash
FORMATS=clickhouse ./generate_queries.sh
``` 

Load data set
```bash
./load_clickhouse.sh
``` 

Run test query set. 
In this example, there are restrictions on both number of concurrent workers and number of test queries to run.
If you have powerful hardware, feel free to rise limits higher. 
```bash
NUM_WORKERS=1 MAX_QUERIES=10 ./run_queries_clickhouse.sh
```

Enjoy results in `/tmp/bulk_queries/result_queries_clickhouse*` files.
