# TSBS Supplemental Guide: VictoriaMetrics

[VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) is fast,
cost-effective and scalable time-series database.
It supports InfluxDB, Graphite and OpenTSDB protocols for ingesting data
and also can be used as long-term remote storage for Prometheus.
This supplemental guide explains how the data generated for TSBS is stored,
additional flags available when using the data importer (`tsbs_load_victoriametrics`),
and additional flags available for the query runner (`tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics`).

To install all required tools pls do following:
```
# Install desired binaries. At a minimum this includes tsbs_generate_data,
# tsbs_generate_queries, one tsbs_load_* binary, and one tsbs_run_queries_*
# binary:
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/timescale/tsbs/cmd
$ cd tsbs_generate_data && go install
$ cd ../tsbs_generate_queries && go install
$ cd ../tsbs_load_victoriametrics && go install
$ cd ../tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics && go install
```

**This should be read *after* the main README.**

## Data format

Data generated by `tsbs_generate_data` for VictoriaMetrics is serialized in
the same format as for InfluxDB. This is "pseudo-CSV" format, each reading
is composed of a single line where the name of the table is the first item,
a comma, followed by several comma-separated items of tags in the format
of `<label>=<value>`, a space, several comma-separated items of fields
in the format of `<label>=<value>`, a space, and finally the timestamp
for the reading.

An example for the `cpu-only` use case:
```text
cpu,hostname=host_0,region=eu-central-1,datacenter=eu-central-1b,rack=21,os=Ubuntu15.10,arch=x86,team=SF,service=6,service_version=0,service_environment=test usage_user=58.1317132304976170,usage_system=2.6224297271376256,usage_idle=24.9969495069947882,usage_nice=61.5854484633778867,usage_iowait=22.9481393231639395,usage_irq=63.6499207106198313,usage_softirq=6.4098777048301052,usage_steal=44.8799140503027445,usage_guest=80.5028770761136201,usage_guest_nice=38.2431182911542820 1451606400000000000
```

Remember to set `-timestamp-start` and `-timestamp-end` flags in range
of VictoriaMetrics [retention period](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics#how-to-start-victoriametrics).
All data out of retention period will be automatically deleted after insertion.

One of the ways to generate data for insertion is to use `scripts/generate_data.sh`:
```text
FORMATS=victoriametrics SCALE=100 TS_START=2021-08-01T00:00:00Z TS_END=2021-08-03T00:00:00Z  ./scripts/generate_data.sh
```

Important: please ensure that VictoriaMetrics retention setting covers the time range
set by TS_START and TS_END params.

## `tsbs_load_victoriametrics`

See recommendations for insertion in [InfluxDB protocol](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf).

One of the ways to load data in VictoriaMetrics is to use `scripts/load_victoriametrics.sh`:
```text
./scripts/load/load_victoriametrics.sh
```
> Assumed that VictoriaMetrics is already installed and ready for insertion on default port `8428`.
  If not - please set `DATABASE_PORT` variable accordingly.
> If you're using cluster version of VictoriaMetrics please specify `vminsert` port (`8480` by default)
  and `DATABASE_PATH=insert/0/influx/write`, where `0` is tenant ID.
  See more about URL format [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format).


### Additional Flags

#### `--urls` (type: `string`, default: `http://localhost:8428/write`)

Comma-separated list of URLs to connect to for inserting data.  It can be
just a single-version URL or list of VMInsert URLs. Workers will be
distributed in a round robin fashion across the URLs.
See more about URL format [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format).

## Generating queries

VictoriaMetrics query language MetricsQL has some limitations comparing to SQL.
Because of this VictoriaMetrics query generator lacks for implementation of query 
types for `devops` use-case: 
* `groupby-orderby-limit` - results are always ordered by time and can't be limited;
* `lastpoint` - can't be queried if datapoint is older than 5 minutes; 
* `high-cpu-1`, `high-cpu-all` - can't be queried without grouping by step.

The `iot` use-case wasn't implemented yet.

One of the ways to generate queries for VictoriaMetrics is to use `scripts/generate_queries.sh`:
```text
 FORMATS=victoriametrics SCALE=100 TS_START=2021-08-01T00:00:00Z TS_END=2021-08-03T00:00:00Z \
 QUERY_TYPES="cpu-max-all-8 double-groupby-1" ./scripts/generate_queries.sh
```

Important: generate queries with same params as used for data loading on previous steps.

---

## `tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics`

To run generated queries follow examples in documentation:
```text
cat /tmp/bulk_queries/victoriametrics-cpu-max-all-8-queries.gz | gunzip | tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics
```

> By default, tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics assumes that VictoriaMetrics is already installed and ready 
  for accepting queries on `http://localhost:8428`. To change the address, please specify `--urls` flags.
> If you're using cluster version of VictoriaMetrics please specify `--urls` flag as
  `http://localhost:8481/select/0/prometheus`, where `localhost:8481` is vmselect address and port,
  and `0` is tenant ID. See more about URL format [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format).


### Additional flags

#### `--urls` (type: `string`, default: `http://localhost:8428`)

Comma-separated list of URLs to connect to for querying. It can be
just a single-version URL or list of VMSelect URLs. Workers will be
distributed in a round robin fashion across the URLs. See help for additional info.

## Troubleshooting

For stable and optimal performance it is recommended running `tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics`
or `tsbs_load_victoriametrics` utilities on a separate instance located in the same network
as VictoriaMetrics installation. This will ensure that neither benchmark utilities nor
VictoriaMetrics components won't interfere for resources with each other.

In order understand the bottlenecks it is recommended to have [monitoring](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Quick-Start.html#monitoring)
in place for the VictoriaMetrics components and also host systems. Please note, that in order to monitor cluster during
the benchmark it is better to use a separate instance of VictoriaMetrics. You can set up a VMSingle on a separate 
machine or on machine which is generating load. This will allow to separate benchmark and monitoring loads during the test.

## Expected numbers

__Updated at 15.08.2023__

For a baseline we conducted a benchmark with the following configuration:
* 3 nodes of vmstorage, vminsert, vmselect located on 3 VMs (1 instance of each per machine) 
4 CPU / 16GB (GCP e2-standard-4 machines), 100GB pd-balanced disks;
* load sent from separate machine of the same type (4 CPU / 16 GB);
* load node had nginx installed to load balance requests between all insert nodes.

Data was generated by the following command:
```text
FORMATS=victoriametrics SCALE=1000 TS_START=2023-08-01T00:00:00Z TS_END=2021-08-10T00:00:00Z  ./scripts/generate_data.sh
```

Load was sent by using the following command:
```text
cat /tmp/bulk_data/victoriametrics-data.gz | gunzip | tsbs_load_victoriametrics --urls="http://localhost:8480/insert/0/influx/write" --workers=16 --batch-size=100000
```

The numbers during the benchmark were the following:
```text
loaded 777600000 metrics in 430.052sec with 16 workers (mean rate 1808153.94 metrics/sec)
loaded 77760000 rows in 430.052sec with 16 workers (mean rate 180815.39 rows/sec)
```
This setup utilized 100% CPU and around 2.6GB of memory during the TSBS run.

The same setup with write and read loads running concurrently has the following results:
* ingestion rate - 1.2M datapoints per second;
* read requests - 8 RPS.

TSBS report:
