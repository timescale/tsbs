# TSBS Supplemental Guide: VictoriaMetrics

[VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) is fast,
cost-effective and scalable time-series database.
It can be used as long-term remote storage for Prometheus.
This supplemental guide explains how the data generated for TSBS is stored,
additional flags available when using the data importer (`tsbs_load_victoriametrics`),
and additional flags available for the query runner (`tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics`).
**This should be read *after* the main README.**

## Data format

Data generated by `tsbs_generate_data` for VictoriaMetrics is serialized in
the same format as for InfluxDB. This is "pseudo-CSV" format, each reading
is composed of a single line where the name of the table is the first item,
a comma, followed by several comma-separated items of tags in the format
of `<label>=<value>`, a space, several comma-separated items of fields
in the format of `<label>=<value>`, a space, and finally the timestamp
for the reading.

An example for the `cpu-only` use case:
```text
cpu,hostname=host_0,region=eu-central-1,datacenter=eu-central-1b,rack=21,os=Ubuntu15.10,arch=x86,team=SF,service=6,service_version=0,service_environment=test usage_user=58.1317132304976170,usage_system=2.6224297271376256,usage_idle=24.9969495069947882,usage_nice=61.5854484633778867,usage_iowait=22.9481393231639395,usage_irq=63.6499207106198313,usage_softirq=6.4098777048301052,usage_steal=44.8799140503027445,usage_guest=80.5028770761136201,usage_guest_nice=38.2431182911542820 1451606400000000000
```

Remember to set `-timestamp-start` and `-timestamp-end` flags in range
of VictoriaMetrics [retention period](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics#how-to-start-victoriametrics).
All data out of retention period will be automatically deleted after insertion.

One of the ways to generate data for insertion is to use `scripts/generate_data.sh`:
```text
FORMATS=victoriametrics TS_START=2019-09-01T00:00:00Z TS_END=2019-09-03T00:00:00Z  ./scripts/generate_data.sh
```

## `tsbs_load_victoriametrics`

See recommendations for insertion in [InfluxDB protocol](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf).

One of the ways to load data in VictoriaMetrics is to use `scripts/load_victoriametrics.sh`:
```text
./scripts/load_victoriametrics.sh
```

### Additional Flags

#### `-urls` (type: `string`, default: `http://localhost:8428/write`)

Comma-separated list of URLs to connect to for inserting data.  It can be
just a single-version URL or list of VMInsert URLs. Workers will be
distributed in a round robin fashion across the URLs.

---

## Generating queries

VictoriaMetrics supports PromQL which has some limitations comparing to SQL.
Because of this VictoriaMetrics query generator lacks for implementation
of query types `groupby-orderby-limit` and `lastpoint`.

Of of the ways to generate queries for VictoriaMetrics is to use `scripts/generate_queries.sh`:
```text
 FORMATS=victoriametrics TS_START=2019-09-01T00:00:00Z TS_END=2019-09-03T00:00:00Z \
 QUERY_TYPES="cpu-max-all-8 double-groupby-1" ./scripts/generate_queries.sh
```

Consider to generate queries with same params as generated data.

---

## `tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics`

To run generated queries follow examples in documentation:
```text
cat /tmp/bulk_queries/victoriametrics-cpu-max-all-8-queries.gz | gunzip | tsbs_run_queries_victoriametrics
```

### Additional flags

#### `-urls` (type: `string`, default: `http://localhost:8428`)

Comma-separated list of URLs to connect to for querying. It can be
just a single-version URL or list of VMSelect URLs. Workers will be
distributed in a round robin fashion across the URLs.
